# Mapping Earthquakes
## Overview
The purpose of this module was to display world earthquake data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner. The data can be viewed on a choice of three world map backgrounds - street, satellite, or dark map views. The data includes three optional layers. The first layer includes all earthquakes within the past 7 days, the second layer shows the location of the earth's tectonic plates, the third layer displays information pertaining to large earthquakes. The user can toggle these layers on and off to see where the earthquakes occur in reference to fault lines. The size and color of each marker represent the strength of an earthquake. Clicking an individual circle will display the magnitude and location of the earthquake. As a whole, the map communicates earthquake information quickly and easily to the user. 

## Examples
Below are examples of the earthquake data with the three map backgrounds. The first two images depict all earthquakes within the past 7 days, while the third image displays only major earthquakes occurring within the past week.
